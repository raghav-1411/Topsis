## Part-I: Command Line TOPSIS Program

### Description
Part-I contains a Python script that implements the TOPSIS algorithm and executes via the command line. It reads a CSV file, applies the TOPSIS method using user-defined weights and impacts, and produces a ranked output CSV file.

### Usage
```bash
python topsis.py <input_file.csv> <weights> <impacts> <output_file.csv>
```

## Part-II: Python Package (PyPI)

### Description
In Part-II, the TOPSIS implementation is packaged as a Python module and uploaded to PyPI, allowing installation via pip and execution using a CLI command.

## Installation
```bash
pip install topsis-raghav-102303580
```

## Part-III: Web Application (Streamlit)

## Description
Part-III provides a web-based interface using Streamlit, enabling users to upload CSV files, specify weights and impacts, and obtain ranked results interactively.
